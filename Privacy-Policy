**Effective Date: [Insert Date]**

## Introduction

Thank you for using **Boulder Buddy**! We value your privacy and want to be transparent about the information we collect and how it is used. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of data we collect and how we handle it within the Boulder Buddy app.

## Information We Collect

Boulder Buddy does not collect any personal information such as your name, email address, or phone number. However, the app integrates with third-party services, which may collect certain types of data for their purposes. These services include:

### 1. AdMob (Google Mobile Ads)

We use **AdMob** to serve ads within the app. AdMob may collect information such as:

- Device information (e.g., device type, operating system)
- IP address
- App usage data

AdMob may use this data to serve personalized ads if you have consented to personalized advertising. If you opt out of personalized ads, you may still see non-personalized ads.

For more information on how AdMob handles data, please refer to [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Google's AdMob & AdSense Policy](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en).

### 2. In-App Purchases

Boulder Buddy includes **In-App Purchases** to enhance your experience, such as removing ads. These purchases are processed through Google Play Store or Apple App Store, depending on your device. The app itself does not handle your payment details. These details are managed and secured by the respective app stores.

We do not collect or store any payment information such as credit card details. The app stores may collect certain personal data to process transactions, and you should review their privacy policies:

- [Google Play Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- [Apple Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/)

## Data Usage

We do not directly collect or store any personal information. However, we use data collected by third parties (e.g., AdMob and in-app purchase platforms) to:

- Display ads in the app
- Enable in-app purchase functionality
- Improve app performance and user experience

## Data Sharing

Boulder Buddy does not sell or share personal information with third parties. However, we do use third-party services, like AdMob, that may collect and share data in accordance with their privacy policies.

## Security

While Boulder Buddy does not collect personal data, we take reasonable measures to protect the integrity and security of the app, including ensuring secure integrations with third-party services like AdMob and the app stores.

## Your Choices

- **Opt-Out of Personalized Ads**: You can opt out of personalized ads through the app’s settings or by adjusting your device’s privacy settings. Even if you opt out, you will continue to see ads, but they will not be tailored to your preferences.
- **Managing In-App Purchases**: You can manage your in-app purchase preferences or restore purchases via the Google Play Store or Apple App Store settings.

## Children’s Privacy

Boulder Buddy is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If we learn that a child under 13 has provided personal information, we will take steps to delete such information.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify users of any significant changes by updating the effective date of the policy.
